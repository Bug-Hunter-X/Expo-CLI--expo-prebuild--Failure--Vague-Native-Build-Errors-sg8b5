Debugging this issue requires systematic investigation.  Here's a breakdown of the troubleshooting steps:

1. **Examine the Full Log:** The most crucial step is carefully reviewing the complete output from the `expo prebuild` and subsequent native build commands. Look for any specific error messages or warnings buried within the log, as these can provide hints about the underlying problem.
2. **Simplify Your Project:** Temporarily comment out parts of your codebase, especially custom native modules or complex dependencies, to see if they are the source of the conflict.  If this isolates the problem, you can address the specific problematic code.
3. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all your dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Outdated or conflicting packages can lead to build errors that are difficult to trace.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the build cache: `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuild from scratch.  Sometimes leftover build artifacts cause issues.
5. **Verify Native Module Setup:** If you're using any custom native modules, ensure that their configurations are correctly set up and compatible with your current setup.  Incorrect configuration can lead to unexpected errors.
6. **Examine Project Structure:**  Verify the structure of your Expo project and its configuration files (`app.json`, `package.json`).  Inconsistent structure can affect the build process.
7. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Make sure you are using the latest versions of Expo CLI and the SDK to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.

The `bug.js` file might contain a simplified project illustrating a potential conflict (e.g., missing dependency, incorrect configuration); however, the key to resolution lies in the systematic troubleshooting steps outlined above.
