This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose error encountered when using the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command. The error manifests as vague errors during the native iOS or Android build process, often lacking specific details.  The `bug.js` file showcases a simplified example project (although the actual cause can be much more complex) and the `bugSolution.js` provides possible solutions and debugging strategies.  Detailed steps and troubleshooting advice are included within the solution file.
