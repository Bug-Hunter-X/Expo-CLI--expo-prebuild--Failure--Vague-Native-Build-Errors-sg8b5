This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, especially if you have a complex project setup or are using a custom native module.  The error message itself is often vague and unhelpful.  The core problem is that Expo's build process fails to correctly prepare the project for the native iOS or Android build, resulting in the native build tools failing.  Debugging this requires careful examination of the logs and potentially exploring various aspects of your project's configuration and dependencies.
